# RER Scraper API

`POST /` starts RER scraper work. The scraper first reads operations from
SmartSuite, then exits with `204 No Content` when there is no work.

When the session-auth API returns `202 Accepted`, the scraper returns:

```json
{"status":"waiting_for_session_refresh"}
```

It also schedules one asynchronous retry. Lambda retries that asynchronous
invocation up to two times while the session refresh remains in progress.

The refresh path enumerates accessible organisations, stations, station details,
certificate summaries, and station-matching certificate breakdowns. SmartSuite
schema mappings for operation records and refreshed data are intentionally not
configured yet.

Transfer preparation uses inclusive `Mon YYYY` periods and selects all matching
certificate ranges for the source station. A range with no matching certificates
is a successful no-op. The scraper does not submit final certificate transfers.

Deploy infrastructure with `sam deploy`, then configure the scraper environment:

```bash
./scripts/sync-scraper-env.sh
```

The sync script reads `RER_SESSION_AUTH_API_URL`,
`RER_SESSION_AUTH_API_KEY_VALUE`, `SMARTSUITE_API_TOKEN`, and
`SMARTSUITE_ACCOUNT_ID` from `.env`.
